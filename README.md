# Location-Based-Reminders

# Abstract
The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient method for users to set reminders for a particular location. This would be particularly useful for reminders for common tasks which (mostly considered to be trivial) a person would usually forget (say, a reminder to check if the user turned off the gas after leaving their house, or a reminder to give attendance once they reach their workplace, etc) that often skip our mind. Therefore, to quote an example of the workflow, if a user sets a reminder called “Pay Fees” at Anna University, then the application would remind the user to pay their fees once they actually reach Anna University. Android Studio (Java) will be used to develop this application including third party APIs for maps and geofencing (Google Maps API). To protect users' data, there will be an OTP mechanism implemented by making use of Firebase and no sensitive data like passwords would be collected or stored by the app.
